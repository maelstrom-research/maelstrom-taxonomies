Maelstrom Research Taxonomies

Thank you for your interest in the Maelstrom Research variable classification taxonomies. 

These classification schemes allow you to annotate study variables with a standardized list of areas of information and, when applicable, the standardized scales/questionnaires used to collect them. A specific taxonomy also allows annotating harmonized datasets. To the end user, these taxonomies facilitate metadata browsing and enhances data discoverability in the Mica web data portal.
